# 'Calendar Program'

### I. Initiative

'Calendar Program' is a utility program set inside a command line interface (without a GUI) that can read, write and edit any entries in a calendar, located inside a text file within the same directory.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics

 - The program must provide the user with the option to view all existing calendar entries, add new calendar entries, and edit any entry that exists within the text file.
 - The program should be able to interact with a text file located in the same directory.
 - The user must be able to view all calendar entries 
 - The user must be able to add any calendar entry to the list
 - The program must provide the user with the choice to edit any existing calendar entry of their choice
 - The user must be able to edit any existing entry

##### Non-Functional Requirements

 - If the user provides the program with an invalid input, they are requested to try again
 - If the computer re-asks the user a question, it is presented on a separate line away from the previous question, to reduce screen clutter
 - ASCII text is used in the text file and presented in the calendar program to look more appealing and easier to read

##### User Stories

 - "As a user, I would want to chose an option between reading, writing and editing existing entries"
 - "As a user, I would want the program to interact with a text file called 'calendar' located in the same directory"
 - "As a user, I would want to read all of the calendar entries"
 - "As a user, I would want to have the calendar entries presented to me in a readable and clear format"
 - "As a user, I would want to add any entry to the calendar"
 - "As a user, I would want to edit any existing entry I chose"
 - "As a user, I would like to be asked again if I type in a wrong choice or edit an entry that does not exist"
 - "As a user, I would like the program to limit the output to only the current month/year etc."
 - "As a user, I would like the program to use a form of time function to print events at the correct time"

##### How We Addressed The Requirements

A plan was devised so that all the functional requirements would be completed with the highest priority, followed by the non-functional requirements.

### III. Genre

A GUI-less, command line utility program

### IV. Technical Details

##### Platform

The program was coded in the Python IDLE Shell. It was useful for fixing problems in my code.
